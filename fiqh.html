This book is the first in the series. It deals with sickness, which continues to afflict human beings from birth until death. Sickness strikes as light as a simple cold or allergy, and as hard as a plague or cancer. It keeps the human being under check, reminding him of his weakness and giving him a chance to turn to the One who possesses to afflict and cure. This book deals with sickness, its regulations, and lessons associated with it. It presents the Islamic stand toward a number of modern medical issues, and also discusses important regulations relating to those with disabilities.

    <div class="main_description">About the Book: In the Evolution of Fiqh (Islamic Law & the Madh-habs), the author very clearly presents a brief overview of the historical development of Islamic law and its schools (the madh-habs).
The book identifies the main reason for the appearance of the madh-habs and the factors leading to differences among them.
For those to whom the madh-habs have been a mystery,this aspect of the book will be extremely enlightening.
Although the author sheds light on both the positive and negative roles of the madh-habs in the past, the main message of the book is a call to the understanding of logistic differences (with an aim to remove them where possible),and a proposal for the unification of the madh-habs.
"What makes this book stimulating are the perceptive and penetrating questions that Abu Ameenah raises.
The book is important as it draws the Muslims' attention to self-criticism that is long overdue."

    <div class="main_description">
In this book, the author has widely described the main principle of Taqleed. He says that Allah and Prophet Mohammed (SAW) have not ordered us to follow any opinions and interpretations. So there's a possibility of being correct or incorrect in the opinions, because there are many issues on which the Imams had different views and they explain them according to their own reasons and speculations, but the real and true Islam is based on the book (Quran) and Prophet's Sunnah.
Allah says: "But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith until they make you judge in all disputed matters between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decision, and accept them with full submission." And prophet said: "I leave you with two things as long as you hold them tightly, you never go astray: they are the book of Allah and my Sunnah." In this sense the author has described the difference between different Madhahib (madhabs/mazhabs), and their views and urged to follow only the Quran and Sunnah.

This book appears at a time when many other books and ideas are being propogated to justify the status quo of the ummah, and the position of those who are not ruling by what Allah has revealed and to detract from the seriousness of the situation.
This book is a detailed discussion of the extreme views of both the Murjiah and Khawaarij, which are clouding the ummahئs vision as they have done for far too long. The view of the Murjiئah states that faith is simply the matter of belief in the heart, which no link to action, whilst the view of the Khawaarij is that any sin equals a mjor kuft act which puts a person beyond the pale of Islam. The author highlights these distorted views, then explains the middle way of Ahl as-Sunnah waئl-Jamaaئah, based on the Qurئan and Sunnah, where faith is composed of both belief and action, and it may increase and decrease; while sin does not necessarily equal a major kuft act, but there are some major sins which do consitute major kufr acts and put a person beyond the pale of Islam, such as ruling by something other than what Allah has revealed.

(Questions and Answers on various topics faced by Muslims every day)
FOREWORD
All praises be to Allah, Lord of honor and glory, who has guided us to be Muslims and made us among the followers of His last Prophet (peace be upon him).
We are pleased to present this valuable and noble collection of 'Fatawa Sirat-e-Mustaqeem' (Islamic verdicts, questions and answers) which have been selected and compiled from the Urdu monthly magazine 'Sirat-e-Mustqaeem' published by Markazi jamiat Ahl-e-Hadith, UK.
The 'Fatawa' (verdicts) to the readers queries and questions on Islamic matters were initially given by the Late Maulana Mahmood Ahmed Mirpuri. His effective method of replying in the light of Qur'an and Sunnah, as well as in accordance to the current issues, no doubt benefited readers worldwide rather than just the one questioner.

Some of the major tribulations of human existence are the consequences of committing sins and spreading evil into the world. According to the moral scale of Islam, it is known that man is imperfect and fallible and prone to committing sins. This is part of his innate weak nature as a finite limited creature. However, it is a sin if he has the ways and means to attain relative moral perfection and deliberately chooses not to seek it.
