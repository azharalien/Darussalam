Darussalarn is proud to present the abridged English translation of the classic work: Al-Bidayah wan Nihayah. This book focuses on the events that took place after the death of the Messenger of Allah, such as the choosing of Abu Bakr as the Caliph, the ghusl of the Prophet and his burial.
The book then discusses the blessed and beautiful characteristics and merits of the Prophet and then goes on to describe the miracles that he performed. Ibn Katheer than compares the miracles given to Prophet Muhammad with those that were given to the other Prophets; he then shows that Prophet Muhammad collectively received the same miracles that were granted to the other Prophets separately.
AI-Bidayah wan Nihayah (The Beginning and The End), by the renowned scholar Abu Al-Fida 'Imad ad-Deen Isma'eel bin 'Umar ibn Katheer, is considered as one of the most authoritative sources on Islamic History.

  In this book, the stories of the prophets have been compiled from 'Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah' (The Beginning and the End) which is a great work of the famous Muslim exegete and historian Ibn Kathir and has a prominent place in the Islamic literature. The stories of the prophets and all the events in their lives have been supported by the Qur'anic Verses and the Sunnah (traditions) of the Prophet (S). Wherever it was necessary, other sources have also been reported for the sake of historical accounts, but on such places a comparative study has been made to prove the authenticity of the sources. Ibn Kathir has reproduced the views and interpretations of all the great exegetes of the Qur'an of his time. The systemic narratives of the Stories of the Prophets have been written in chronological order which renders a historical style to the book.

Who among us does not sin? And who among us does all that is required of him in the religion?
It is an undeniable fact that we all have shortcomings; what distinguishes some of us from the others, what raises some of us above the others, is that the successful ones among us are those who repent their sins and ask Allah to forgive them.
It is truly encouraging to know that the door to repentance is always open. Glad tidings, then, to every Muslim who constantly and consistently hastens to repent to Allah and to ask for His forgiveness.

This book is an abridged English translation from the great work of Ibn Katheer, Al-Bidayah wan Nihayah. This second part consists of the stories of Prophet Musa, Samuel, Zakariyyah, Yahya, Eeesa (Jesus), Dhu'l Qarnayn, and Luqman. It also covers the children of Israa'eel (Bani Israeel), divine scriptures and past nations.
The exact number of prophets and messengers sent by Allah is not known, but the Qur'an makes clear that all of the prophets were sent to various nations to preach Islamic monotheism.
Muslims believe that all the Divine Messengers — including those in common with Judaism and Christianity — conveyed the same message of true monotheism and submission to the one God, Allah. Belief in these prophets and messengers is an essential part of the Islamic faith and Muslims do not differentiate between them, according them all the same respect and reverence.

History stands as the most effective and valuable source of putting nation on the course of progress and prosperity and saving them from the path of disgrace and degradation.
At a time, when there is tough competition among the nations of the world to excel one another, the Muslim, despite having the most glorious history, appear to be detached and careless as regards their history.
This book presents the true Islamic events and their actual causes before the English readers because the other books in the English language found on the Islamic history have been written by such authors and compilers who did no justice in presenting the true picture of Islamic Era but their prejudice prevented them from doing so.
